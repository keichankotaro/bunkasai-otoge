### User Request: Ultimate Debugger for Unity

**Goal:** Implement an "ultimate debugger" for a Unity rhythm game. This debugger should use socket communication to send data from Unity to a Python GUI program. The Python program should have a "cool and romantic" GUI. The data to be sent includes information about the next note to be judged for each lane, specifically a part of the note's JSON raw data, and also speed change data from the `speeddata` section. The user also requested a datasheet for the debugger.

### Initial Clarification & Plan (Model)

1.  **Notes Processing Identification:** Asked which scripts handle note judgment and music time. Suggested `playmusic.cs` or `ScoreManeger.cs` and requested permission to read them.
2.  **Data to Send:** Clarified the specific note data fields (Lane Index, Note ID, Time, Type) and the need to include the raw note JSON and `speeddata` section.
3.  **Proposed Development Plan:**
    *   **Step 1: Existing Code Analysis:** Read relevant scripts.
    *   **Step 2: Python GUI Debugger Development:** Use `Dear PyGui` for a cool, futuristic console look. Features: per-lane note display, connection status, log.
    *   **Step 3: Unity C# Client Development:** Use UDP for low latency. Simple API for sending data.
    *   **Step 4: Datasheet Creation:** `DEBUGGER_DATASHEET.md` covering setup, usage, and data format.

### User Response & Further Clarification

*   **Notes Processing:** User stated note processing is spread across multiple files (e.g., `L(lane)_duplication.cs`, `L(lane).cs`) and asked the model to find relevant ones.
*   **Data to Send:** Confirmed sending raw note JSON (e.g., `{"speed": 0.2, "time": 14.16, "type": "tap"}`) and mentioned a `s_change` boolean and `speeddata` section, but was unsure of their exact behavior/location.

### Model's Code Analysis & Refined Plan

1.  **Chart Data Inspection:** Requested to read `Resources/Charts/test-chart.json` to understand chart structure.
    *   Found `maindata` and `chartdata` with per-lane note info.
    *   `speeddata` and `s_change` were *not* found in `test-chart.json`.
2.  **Further Chart Data Inspection:** Requested to read `Resources/Charts/Hard/World Vanquisher.json` (as it's a more complex chart).
    *   Still no `speeddata` or `s_change` found in the initial read (due to truncation).
3.  **`playmusic.cs` Inspection:** Read `playmusic.cs`.
    *   Confirmed `Newtonsoft.Json.Linq` for JSON parsing and `adata.jsonObj` for chart data.
    *   Noted that `playmusic.cs` handles music playback but not individual note generation/judgment.
4.  **`adata.cs` Inspection:** Read `adata.cs`.
    *   Identified `adata` as a static class holding global game state, including `jsonObj` and `game_time`.
    *   Concluded that `L(lane).cs` scripts likely use `adata.game_time` and `adata.jsonObj` for note logic.
5.  **User Hint: `SpeedManager.cs` and `L(lane).cs` for speed changes.**
6.  **`SpeedManager.cs` Inspection:** Read `SpeedManager.cs`.
    *   **Crucially, found `speeddata` section handling!** It dynamically updates `adata.speed` based on time-triggered changes or cubic bezier formulas.
7.  **`L1.cs` Inspection:** Read `L1.cs`.
    *   Confirmed `L(lane).cs` scripts manage individual notes, use `isPreviousObjectDestroyed` to identify the "next" note, and calculate note speed using `adata.speed` and the note's own `speed` property. Also handles note-specific speed changes (`s_change` and `changes`).

### Finalized Development Plan (Approved by User)

*   **Part 1: Python GUI Debugger (Server):**
    *   File: `Assets/ultimate_debugger_ui.py`
    *   Tech: `Dear PyGui` (futuristic console theme).
    *   Features: UDP server, 4 lane panels, 1 SpeedManager panel, real-time JSON display, flash effects on data receipt, connection indicator.
*   **Part 2: Unity C# Client (Sender):**
    *   File: `Assets/DebugSocketClient.cs`
    *   Tech: C# `System.Net.Sockets` (UDP).
    *   Features: Singleton, `SendData(string jsonPayload)` method.
*   **Part 3: Existing Script Integration:**
    *   `L1.cs`, `L2.cs`, `L3.cs`, `L4.cs`: Add code to send note JSON data via `DebugSocketClient` when `isPreviousObjectDestroyed` becomes true (i.e., when it becomes the "next" note). Use a `debugDataSent` flag to send only once.
    *   `SpeedManager.cs`: Add code to send `speeddata` event details via `DebugSocketClient` whenever `adata.speed` is updated.
*   **Part 4: Datasheet Creation:**
    *   File: `Assets/DEBUGGER_DATASHEET.md`
    *   Content: Architecture, Python/Unity setup, usage, data format, troubleshooting.

### Implementation Steps & Issues

1.  **Created `Assets/ultimate_debugger_ui.py`**.
    *   **Issue:** `AttributeError: module 'dearpygui.dearpygui' has no attribute 'mvFont_Default'`.
    *   **Resolution:** Modified `ultimate_debugger_ui.py` to remove explicit font binding, relying on `dearpygui`'s default font handling.
2.  **Created `Assets/DebugSocketClient.cs`**.
3.  **Modified `Assets/SpeedManager.cs`** to send speed data.
    *   **Issue:** C# compilation errors (`CS1002`, `CS1055`, `CS1513`, `CS8124`, `CS1022`, `CS1003`, `CS1525`, `CS1026`, `CS0106`) due to incorrect C# string interpolation for JSON.
    *   **Resolution:** Replaced string interpolation with `JObject` construction for safer JSON serialization.
4.  **Modified `Assets/L1.cs`** to send note data.
    *   **Issue:** Same C# compilation errors as `SpeedManager.cs`.
    *   **Resolution:** Replaced string interpolation with `JObject` construction for safer JSON serialization.
5.  **Modified `Assets/L2.cs`** to send note data.
    *   **Issue:** Same C# compilation errors.
    *   **Resolution:** Replaced string interpolation with `JObject` construction.
6.  **Modified `Assets/L3.cs`** to send note data.
    *   **Issue:** Same C# compilation errors.
    *   **Resolution:** Replaced string interpolation with `JObject` construction.
7.  **Modified `Assets/L4.cs`** to send note data.
    *   **Issue:** Same C# compilation errors.
    *   **Resolution:** Replaced string interpolation with `JObject` construction.
8.  **Created `Assets/DEBUGGER_DATASHEET.md`**.

### Current Status

All C# files have been modified to use `JObject` for JSON serialization, which should resolve the compilation errors. The Python GUI script has also been updated to fix the `dearpygui` font issue. The `DEBUGGER_DATASHEET.md` has been created.

**Next Step:** User needs to verify if the Unity compilation errors are resolved.
